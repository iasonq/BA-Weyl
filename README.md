# BA-Weyl
A project on the application of Lie groups  differential equations. The equation treated is the Weyl equation. 


p1 contains the first part of the project, which was to do the prolongation and find the relations of the functions

p2 further expands on these results where we find the symmetries and symmetry group. In the end we also find the commutation relations between every symmetry operator of the group.
