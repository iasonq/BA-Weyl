# BA-Weyl
A project on the application of Lie groups differential equations. In this case we treat a system of partial differential equations known as the Weyl equation.


p1 contains the first part of the project, which was to do the prolongation and find the relations of the functions

p2 further expands on these results where we find the symmetries and symmetry group. In the end we also find the commutation relations between every symmetry operator of the group.

Ideally at some point I will clean up the code and make it more readable.

(It has been a long time since I did this project and the description might be somewhat inaccurate)
